* Strategy Name:
    strategy_01

* Entry Setup:
    Based on supertrend indicator when it crosses price chart.

* Take Profit Setup:


* Stop loss setup:


* Trading Approach:


* Portfolio Exposure for this Strategy: 
    % 100 of portfolio balance

* Risk Per Trade:
    % 1 of portfolio exposure

* Position Sizing:
    Based on "VaR" and "Kelly Criterion" methods. by considering probable price slippage and the
    leverage calculate position size in a way that it won't lose more than the specified 
    risk_per_trade at the state of trade with highest risk (it's the initial stop loss level). it
    means that if the stop-loss oredr gets hit by price and we get out of position, it won't lose
    more than the specified risk_per_trade (also have to consider the probable slippage for 
    stop-loss order which is a stop-market-price order)

    It consists of calculating the kelly_fraction with this formula:
        kelly_fraction = win_rate - (1 - win_rate) / win_loss_ratio
    then calculating the max_loss_per_trade_value by this formula:
        max_loss_per_trade_value = risk_per_trade_pst * capital
    then calculating adjusted_stop_loss with this formula:
        adjusted_stop_loss = stop_loss_pct + probable_slippage_pct
    then the position size would be :
        position_size = max_loss_per_trade_value / (adjusted_stop_loss * leverage)
    
    then position size would be the {kelly_fraction * capital (also considering leverage here)} if
    it is no exceeding the max_loss_per_trade_value othervise position size is equal to 
    {max_loss_per_trade_value / (adjusted_stop_loss * leverage)}.
